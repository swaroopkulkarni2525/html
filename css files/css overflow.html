        Step 1: Find the largest number in the given array 
        Step 2: count how many number of digits that the largest number has and equate all the to that number example: if 100 is the largest number in the array then equating all the other numbers as three digit numbers 
        Step 3: Insert the numbers into an buckets. In every pass it start from (LSB) 
        Step 4:  By using the for loops we alter the numbers.  
        Step 5 :  It will be sorted acceding orderStep 1: Find the largest number in the given array
