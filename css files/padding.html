            The Entity–Relationship model (ER model) describes the structure of a database with the help of a diagram, which is known as Entity Relationship Diagram (ER Diagram)
An Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) shows the relationships of entity sets stored in a database. An entity in this context is an object, a component of data.
An entity set is a collection of similar entities. These entities can have attributes that define its properties. By defining the entities, their attributes, and showing the relationships between them, an ER diagram illustrates the logical structure of database.
ER diagrams are used to sketch out the design of a database.
